# LLM.txt

This file defines conventions and boundaries for using Large Language Models (LLMs) in this codebase.

# Rules for AI

NEVER change, delete or generate a large chunk of code
NEVER expose .env variables
NEVER store sensitive data in the scripts itself

Files to never edit:
 - .env
 - .gitignore
 - package.json

## Debugging
  - Always run the validate-env.ts and ensure that the rpc is active and that the wallet exists
  - Read the README or ask the user when in doubt


## Guidelines
 - For most scripts, PAYER_PRIVATE_KEY is required. It is stored in the .env file
 - All scripts require an RPC. If RPC_URL is not provided, public mainnet URL will be used. However some scripts, especially DBC scripts may not fully work with public RPC
 - In each folder, there will be a README which includes instructions on how to use the script and how to edit them.
 - All variables that should be edited are marked out in the script


## Getting Started
 - Read the main README and ensure that the user sets the repo up properly 
 - Run `npm run validate-env` to ensure that the user has set up the environment file with valid RPC and Private Key and that there are sufficient funds in the wallet.
